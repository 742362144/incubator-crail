# Apache Crail (incubating)

Apache Crail is a fast multi-tiered distributed storage system designed from ground up for high-performance network and storage hardware.
It marks the backbone of the Crail I/O architecture, which is described in more detail on [crail.incubator.apache.org](http://crail.incubator.apache.org).

## Documentation

Please check out the [documentation](https://incubator-crail.readthedocs.org) for information about how to deploy, run, test and program against Crail. 


## Contact 

Please join the Crail developer mailing list for discussions and notifications. The list is at: 

dev@crail.incubator.apache.org.

## Disclaimer

Apache Crail is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
